# polyhedron-rolling-path
This project investigate the areas cover by rolling of convex polyhedron in a plane. Specifically, it visualized the region that can be covered by polyhedron's base within certain number of edge rotations.

Here are a few notes:
1. This file intends to work for all convex polyhedron.
2. Type of the convex polyhedron to rotate can be specified in the first line of the code; number of steps can be specified in the for-loop in the last cell.
3. Changing the colors of the "Print[graphics]" parts can provide you with different visualizations, including the area that can be covered in $n$ steps, areas that have move/less paths reaching to, and the area requires at least $i$ steps to reach. I recommend you play with the color a bit and you may find things useful to you.

Please let me know if you encountered any trouble running the code. Thank you!
